# SQL--Health-Expense-and-Suicide-Rate

Relationships between overall health investment (as a mental health proxy) and suicide rates are a key index to watch. We expect a positive effect of more expenditure in health topics, giving away less rates of suicides in countries worldwide. The hope of less suicides brings us a light of answers of where to put our efforts, even though this job does not consider other relevant factors such as socioeconomical development, private and public actions, and individuals characteristics.

This data was downloaded from the WHO Mortality stats published and ICD10 death classification codes. In this project, I will use PostgreSQL to analyze the dataset and use Tableau dashboard to present my findings. The project aims to address a few main questions below:

1. What are the general trend of the world's health expense and suicide rate?

2. Are there relationships between different variables? (E.g. Depression index and suicide rate)

3. What is the general distribution of suicide rate around the globe? Is the result reasonable considering health expenses and potential socialeconomic factors?

Explannation:

Mental Health Expenditure index: Government expenditures on mental hospitals means the government expenditures on mental hospitals as a percentage of total government expenditures on mental health. Nominator: Mental hospital expenditures (in local currency) / Denominator: Total mental health expenditures (in local currency).

Also please note that not every country is included in the dataset, and the analysis and result cannot be a representation of the world.
